            <h2>Day One</h2>
            <p>I set off on my first day heading to Brussels Airport, carrying my luggage and some belongings. My flight was two hours from Brussels to Valencia. The weather was very good, and the sun was just right. I was a bit tired, but I was very excited to see the sea. When I arrived at the accommodation, I left my luggage there and went straight to the beach. I enjoyed walking, even though the distance was quite far, about 20 minutes. After that, I joined the rest of the team, and we headed to a bar to taste some drinks in the city center. We talked a little, and the place was very enjoyable. Then, we went to eat at a beef restaurant. The food was very delicious, and it was around eight in the evening. Afterwards, we toured the city up close, but we lost our friend Niko, who went to the bathroom and didn't return. We searched for him for a long time, but he couldn't contact us for some reason. We decided to return to the accommodation and informed them about the situation. After a few hours, Nico returned to us, and we went to sleep.</p>

            <h2>Day Two</h2>
            <p>The second day was more exciting. We went to the university to attend our first lesson about the project. They divided us into groups, each person from a different university, so that each group consisted of three people randomly to build a special application. We divided the work, chose ideas among ourselves, and prepared images to ensure our project was good. After lunch, we went to the city center with the rest of the groups to see the historical buildings and Spanish heritage. We visited landmarks in the city center.</p>

            <h2>Day Four</h2>
            <p>We went to the university, feeling a bit tired from staying up late, but time passed quickly due to our enthusiasm. We created the application design, required designs, and basic plans. After school, we went to the Science Museum in the city center, which was very enjoyable. There were some spacecraft, space rocks, advanced technology, and pictures of stars and airplanes.</p>

            <h2>The Last Day</h2>
            <p>I woke up early and went to the university at seven in the morning to finish the final details of the project. I learned a lot from this project, and my experience grew. After finishing the project, we returned to having fun again, going shopping and collecting gifts for friends, eating, and drinking. Then, I packed my bags for travel and was ready to make the most of my time. We roamed the streets until two in the morning until the end.</p>
